This is a project within the Odin Project. The goal of this project is to get a better understanding of HTML(5) and CSS(3). To get a better understanding of how these technologies are being used by proffessionals, we are going to deconstruct a page and rebuild it. In addition to that, this is the first time I will build within a local enviorment instead of in CODEPEN.
